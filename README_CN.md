Welcome toNerveSource code library for！

NerveIt is a decentralized digital asset service network. It is based onNULSMicroservices framework, usingNULS ChainBoxDevelop and build a blockchain cross chain interaction protocol. Intended to break the value island of blockchain and establish a cross chain interoperability asset exchange networkDefiThe application ecosystem provides underlying support. Enable digital asset holders to enjoy true security、free、TransparentDefiApplication services.
adoptNerveCross chain interaction protocol, which only requires a small amount of development through standard interfaces, can transform blockchains of different structures into a setNULSCommon asset types that can be recognized by cross chain modules in the ecosystem. So as to connectNULSAsset interactions within and outside the ecosystem, as well as mainstream digital assets such asBTCWaiting to provide richDefiUsage scenario.

at presentNerveCurrently under intense development、During the debugging phase, the code is still very unstable, and technicians will periodically push new versions of the code togithubIn the warehouse.

We also warmly welcome and hope that more developers can join usNerveZhonglai.
